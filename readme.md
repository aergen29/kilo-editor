# Kilo - A Minimal Text Editor in C

This project is a simple terminal-based text editor written in **C**, inspired by the [Kilo tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/).
The purpose of this project is to explore low-level terminal I/O, understand raw mode, and handle keyboard input in a Unix-like system.

## Features

✅ Terminal-based interface  
✅ Basic cursor movement with arrow keys  
✅ Dynamic screen drawing based on terminal size  
✅ Minimal dependencies (`unistd.h`, `termios.h`, etc.)  
✅ A solid foundation to build more advanced text editing features
